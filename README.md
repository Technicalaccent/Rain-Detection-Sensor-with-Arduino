Rain Detection Sensor with Arduino

A simple Rain Detection System can be easily built by interfacing an Arduino with Rain Sensor. The sensor will detect any rainfall falling on it and the Arduino board will sense it and can perform required actions. A system like this can be used in many different fields, such as agriculture and automobile fields. Rainfall detection can be used to automatically regulate the Irrigation process. Also, continuous rainfall data can help farmers use this smart system to automatically water the crop only when absolutely required. Similarly, in the automobiles sector windshield wipers can be made fully automatic by using the rain detection system. And the Home Automation Systems can also use rain detection to automatically close windows and adjust room temperature.
